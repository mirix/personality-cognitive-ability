# Correlations between personality traits and cognitive abilities

Python script to extract, in parseable format, table S89 from the [supporting information](https://www.pnas.org/doi/suppl/10.1073/pnas.2212794120/suppl_file/pnas.2212794120.sapp.pdf) of the following article:

[K. C. Stanek, D. S. Ones, Meta-analytic relations between personality and cognitive ability. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 120 (2023).](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2212794120)

You do not need to run the script as all the output files are already provided in this repository, as follows:

- Table S89 (in CSV and Excel formats).
  
- Average of the confidence intervals from table S89 (also in CSV and Excel formats). Note that these averages do not exactly coincide with the mean values provided in Table 1 of the article (we have not extracted any information from the actual article to avoid any potential copyright infringements).

- A PDF file containing figures S1 and S2 to assist with the interpretation of the tables.

Happy number-crunching!
